# 🚀 IBM Data Science Capstone Project: [Project Title - e.g., SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction]

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The main goal was to **[briefly describe the main goal, e.g., predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings]**.

We used real-world data to perform **[mention key techniques, e.g., Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning classification, and visualization]** to build and evaluate models that achieve high accuracy in predicting outcomes.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Techniques Used

The project leveraged several core Python libraries and data science techniques:

### Tools & Libraries
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebooks**
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and EDA.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN).
* **SQL/SQLite (Optional):** For database management.
* **Folium (Optional):** For geographical visualization.

### Key Methodologies
* **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Gathering data from **[mention source, e.g., web scraping using BeautifulSoup]** and preparing it for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and relationships in launch data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Preparing relevant input variables for the models.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Comparing several classification algorithms to determine the best performer.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `notebooks/`: Contains the sequential Jupyter notebooks used for data processing and model building.
    * `1_EDA_and_Visualization.ipynb`: Initial analysis and data plotting.
    * `2_Machine_Learning_Model_Building.ipynb`: Training, testing, and comparing classification models.
* `data/`: Stores the cleaned and raw datasets used in the project.
    * `[data_file_name.csv]`
* `README.md`: This file.

## 📈 Key Findings & Best Model

### Results Summary
After comparing several classification algorithms, the **[Best Model Name, e.g., Logistic Regression]** model provided the highest performance on the test dataset.

* **Best Model Accuracy:** **[Highest Accuracy Score, e.g., 83.33%]**
* **Critical Insight:** **[Mention a key finding, e.g., The model was highly effective at predicting successful landings, achieving zero False Negatives, which is critical for aerospace applications.]**
